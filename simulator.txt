set traffic limits:
    each wifi device produces 25 Mbps
    each cell device produces x amnt of traffic per hr
    efficient network = y traffic per hr
    each freq band will have a max amnt of traffic it can handle

set time intervals:
    8-12pm: high wifi usage (wifi:cell = 70:30), max capacity
    12-3pm: high cell usage (wifi:cell = 30:70), max capacity
    3-5pm: high wifi usage (wifi:cell = 80:20), max capacity
    5-7pm: high cell usage (wifi:cell = 40:60), max capacity
    7pm-12am: high wifi usage (wifi:cell = 75:25)
    12am-8am: low cell and wifi usage (wifi:cell = 50:50), 50% max capacity

initially:
randomly generate x base stations (max 100)
1-x hotspots
for each base station in x, hotspot in 1-x:
    randomly generate y devices (out of max 100) to be active
    assign a freq band

for timestep t in 1 to 24:
    determine interval i for time t
    based on i, randomly regenerate num of wifi and cell devices based on ratios + capacity
    based on initial distribution of devices to hotspots and base stations, allocate new num of devices to each to maintain same distribution
    each hotspot/base station requests spectrum for new x num of devices
    DB calculates projected traffic for x num of devices
        if project traffic is over the max traffic for currently assigned freq band:
            DB checks if larger freq band available:
                if yes:
                    DB assigns larger freq band sufficient to handle the new traffic
                else:
                    DB assign same freq band
                    record diff b/w current traffic and current freq band's max traffic (performance/throughput degradation metric)
        else:
            DB assign same freq band
    calculate the total load on the network by summing each device's individual traffic
    record diff between current traffic and efficient network traffic threshold (performance/throughput degradation metric)
