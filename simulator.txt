set traffic limits:
    each wifi router produces 25 Mbps of traffic 
    each cell device produces x amnt of traffic per hr
    efficient network = y traffic per hr
    each freq band will have a max amnt of traffic it can handle

set time intervals:
    8-12pm: high wifi usage (wifi:cell = 70:30), max capacity --> data volume 
    12-3pm: high cell usage (wifi:cell = 30:70), max capacity
    3-5pm: high wifi usage (wifi:cell = 80:20), max capacity
    5-7pm: high cell usage (wifi:cell = 40:60), max capacity
    7pm-12am: high wifi usage (wifi:cell = 75:25)
    12am-8am: low cell and wifi usage (wifi:cell = 50:50), 50% max capacity

    -- change in traffic levels (more spectrum/ infrastructure)
    -- # of devices > capacity 
    -- radius of base station 
    -- each device - same amt of traffic 

    -- time frame over years - increase data volume over the years 
        -- determine which one dont have sufficient data use 
        -- operators always spend enough 
    -- sim calls for another base station to be added --> determine the cost of this [2nd step]
        -- wifi: routers (?) --> interfere *** ($$)
            -- remove traffic from wifi network --> offload to the wired alt 
            -- runs in a different band (@80/ 160 Mhz) 
            -- upgrade routers to handle more bandwidth  *** ($$)
    -- performance for current infrastructure 
    -- Spectrum --> base station capacity (100 MHz + 100) --> cap 2x 
        -- current amt of spectrum/ base station (300 MHz) (total spectum/ #of operators)
        -- db can assign +100 to that operator --> 300 to 400 --> 1/3 rd more cap 

    -- distribution of devices connected to each base station changes [area specific business vs residential etc.]
    -- hourly time frame 
    -- yearly time frame (higher traffic)
        -- will need to increase capacity 

    -- Request --> db --> reassigning 

initially:
randomly generate x base stations (max 100)
1-x hotspots
for each base station in x, hotspot in 1-x:
    randomly generate y devices (out of max 100) to be active
    assign a freq band

for timestep t in 1 to 24:
    determine interval i for time t
    based on i, randomly regenerate num of wifi and cell devices based on ratios + capacity
    based on initial distribution of devices to hotspots and base stations, allocate new num of devices to each to maintain same distribution
    each hotspot/base station requests spectrum for new x num of devices
    DB calculates projected traffic for x num of devices
        if project traffic is over the max traffic for currently assigned freq band:
            DB checks if larger freq band available:
                if yes:
                    DB assigns larger freq band sufficient to handle the new traffic
                else:
                    DB assign same freq band
                    record diff b/w current traffic and current freq band's max traffic (performance/throughput degradation metric)
        else:
            DB assign same freq band
    calculate the total load on the network by summing each device's individual traffic
    record diff between current traffic and efficient network traffic threshold (performance/throughput degradation metric)
