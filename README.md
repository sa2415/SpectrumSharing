# Dynamic Spectrum Allocation Simulator

This project simulates a dynamic spectrum allocation system across a city, modeling interactions between Wi-Fi hotspots (HS), cellular base stations (BS), and a centralized database. The system is designed to efficiently allocate upper 6 GHz band spectrum (6.5‚Äì7.2 GHz) based on traffic demand and population density over time.

## üß† Purpose

The goal of this simulator is to evaluate the efficiency of a **centralized database** approach for managing spectrum sharing between Wi-Fi and cellular networks in a growing city environment. The simulation tracks:

- Spectrum demand and usage  
- Device distribution (BS and HS)  
- Traffic fluctuations over time  
- Population growth and its effects  
- Efficiency metrics like spectral utilization and conflict resolution

## üöÄ How It Works

### 1. Grid Initialization

- The city is modeled as a 2D grid of `N x N` cells.
- Each cell is assigned a **population density level**:
  - `0`: Sparse  
  - `1`: Medium  
  - `2`: Dense

### 2. Traffic Demand Simulation

- Every 4 simulated hours, traffic demand is recalculated based on population density:
  - Density 0: 2‚Äì5 MHz  
  - Density 1: 10‚Äì40 MHz  
  - Density 2: 50‚Äì90 MHz

### 3. Device Placement

- **Wi-Fi hotspots (HS)** and **Base stations (BS)** are distributed across the grid.
- Their quantity per cell is determined by local demand and density.

### 4. Spectrum Allocation

- Spectrum is dynamically allocated between 6.5‚Äì7.2 GHz.
- Spectrum blocks are assigned according to:
  - Device type (Wi-Fi vs. Cellular)
  - Interference constraints (`D_w = 20m`, `D_c = 500m`)
  - Priority: Cellular gets preferential treatment when conflicts arise.
- A **centralized database** resolves conflicts and coordinates frequency reassignments.

### 5. Conflict Resolution & Queueing

- If a device can‚Äôt be allocated spectrum, it is added to a queue.
- The system periodically retries allocation from the queue.

### 6. Population Growth

- Over a year-long simulation, population increases by 20%.
- The simulator evaluates how the system copes with increasing traffic demands and population shifts.

### 7. Metrics and Visualization

- Key metrics include:
  - Spectrum utilization
  - Number of unallocated devices
  - Queue sizes
  - Total bandwidth served
- Results are plotted over time for analysis.

## üì¶ Requirements

Make sure to install required Python libraries:

```bash 
pip install numpy matplotlib
```

  Visualizes the total bandwidth usage efficiency.

- üåÜ **Traffic Demand Heatmap**  
  Shows bandwidth demand across the city grid.


- üìâ **Unallocated Devices vs Time**  
  Tracks how many HS/BS couldn‚Äôt be assigned spectrum due to conflicts.

- üí° **Total Bandwidth Served**  
  Measures overall spectrum allocation success over time.
